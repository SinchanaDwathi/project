**Ecoverve - Waste Management System Dashboard**

**Overview**
EcoWaste is a web-based dashboard application for tracking and managing waste collection. The system allows waste management administrators to log collections, monitor bin statuses, and view collection analytics through a user-friendly interface built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

**Key Features**
- Dashboard with summary metrics (total waste collected, active bins, scheduled pickups)
- Collection management form for adding new waste entries
- Real-time collection activity table
- Support for multiple waste categories (Plastic, Paper, Metal, Organic, Glass)
- Responsive design for all devices

**Technical Implementation**
The application is built with a simple frontend-only approach using Tailwind CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. The dashboard includes a sidebar navigation, metrics cards, a form for data entry, and a dynamic table that updates when new collections are added.

**Current Status & Roadmap**
The current implementation includes a functional UI with basic interactive elements. Future plans include adding user authentication, data persistence with a backend database, analytics charts for waste trends, mobile app integration, and route optimization features for collection vehicles.

The project is designed for organizations looking to digitize their waste management operations, providing a centralized platform to monitor collection efficiency and environmental impact.
